# MSTpost Tracker

### Quickstart

A quick tool to display post information by a specified user in Microsoft Teams.

In order to run it you will need to be in a web browser console. To access the console, select the three lines (or dots or Chrome) at the top right hand side of browswer window. Then select the "More Tools" option. There you will see the option to access the console. In Chrome, you will click "Developer tools" and in Firefox, "Web Developer Tools".

At this point, another window should appear from the bottom of your screen. The current tab is on the "Inspector", but to run this code, we will need to be in the "Console" tab. Within the Console tab there is a terminal where the code will be pasted and ran. 

Copy and paste the code from "main.js" into the terminal. Remember to replace 'John Doe' with your own name.

You should see the results in the other pane of the window.
